There's this age-old computer science problem... well problem for computer scientists anyway.

As world-class loners, prom dates are hard to come by. This means we're usually the ones who have the last pick.

That got me thinking... what is the maximum number of girls I can ask to prom given the last pick?
So I've put together a little web service for people to list down potential prom dates. We'll assume everyone else gets to exhaust their list first so all you'll have is a count of available dates. (keep in mind that at least everybody has the same minimum number, that being zero)

Good luck listing :)
