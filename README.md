There's this age old computer science problem... well problem for computer scientists anyway.

As world-class loners, prom dates are hard to come by. This means we're usually the ones who have last pick.

That got me thinking... what is the maximum number of girls I can ask to prom given last pick?
So I've put together a little web service for people to list down their prom dates. We'll assume every other person gets to exhaust their list first so all you'll have left is a count of available dates.

Good luck listing :)
